    ## 02/16/25
    good morning. it is 2 am. i just got back from DJing at a casual open decks event a friend was hosting for his birthday. it was awesome. i think as soon as i stepped into my apartment the seratonin vanished because turns out my Laundry that i Put in the Washing Machine is Cold For Some God Damn Reason I HAVE TO MOVE OUT!!!!!
    not to mention i am SWAMPED with homework again like every week it seems. i guess i do get somewhat of a breather for a bit (for unfortunate reasons) but im still out here with 6+ assigments every week along with my internship... its a lot!! imma miss all my friends here and i will miss the unlimited access to gear here at school but god. i gotta move out.

    ## 02/10/25

    good morning. it is 1 pm and i am tired of existing. not in like a suicidal way but GODDDD i need a life 
    changing event in my life because right now things are boring and depressing and really busy. 

    i think its because mondays are my slowest days as i have a 2 hour class, then a 3 hour class right after, then a 2 hour break and then another 2 hours of class time ughhhhhhh

    im so hungry im getting food after even if i got stuff in the fridge. thats dinner now.

     

    ## 02/07/25

    first of all, sorry for scaring anyone off, im doing a lil better but still going through it. i do appreciate everyone that's been helping me out with
    all of this but it's been really hard to not give up and quit music cause Lord Almighty its difficult. but we still here

    ## 02/05/25

    this might be it tbh. it's been a good run

    ## 02/04/25
    i dont know who's reading this whether its a professor or a friend or a random person who stumbled upon this but things are gonna get dark

    so uh. february hasn't started off too great. my mental health has once again tanked and its gotten to the point where i dont even
    want to make music anymore. thats my livelihood. thats all i fucking do. shit has gotten that bad. it got so bad a friend had to travel from 3
    states over to visit me and to hang out, which i appreciate a lot but she could've come over any time.

    and i appreciate it a lot. i really do thank everyone that has helped me through these hard times. but unfortunately this is not the first time this
    has happened and this will certainly not be the last. i just know im gonna be tested again but this time i will actually just straight up fucking
    die or harm myself unless things get better. and i hate to be pessimistic but given the classes im taking. the workload i have. everything i got so far, i don't know. 

    "so whats the point of all of this? who cares? you want attention? you're trying to guilt trip me into feeling sympathetic to you?"

    i dont know. i certainly dont intend on it and i truly don't mean to. over the years ive basically been hiding the shit ive been going through because
    of a lot of these questions that i ask myself (and have been asked before unfortunately), and while it's good that im able to hold myself back from
    being extremely open about wanting to die, bottling it up doesnt help either. i don't want to be the boy who cried wolf, but i can't hold it all in anymore.

    thanks for reading if you see this. i'm trying my best to get through it all but life fucking sucks when you have a mood disorder
